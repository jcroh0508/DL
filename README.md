1. study of the related literature
2. research method
3. experimental results
4. system architecture

### 1. Introduction
The contribution of this paper is to propose a new forecasting model for the price of e-commerce products.
```markdown
* **Focus: forecasting the price of house property and electronic products using sentiment news from Baidu**
```


### 2. Related literature
```markdown
* The team tried to use different models to test to predict different prices
* **Traditional economic methods (e.g. price of egg)**
    * traditional regression analysis + normality
    * autocorrelated + heteroscedasticity tests

It showed better result when they combined two prediction models, which made it complementary. Hybrid models showed better result. Combining:
* Mean Absolute Error
* MSE
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
```


### 3. Research method
```markdown
3.1. **Price preciction algorithms**
1. Moving average (MA) model
2. Autoregressive (AR) model
3. Autoregressive moving average (AMRA) model
```
